#### Abstract

Since Manchu characters are written vertically and are connected without spaces within a word, a preprocessing
process is required to separate the character area and the units that make up the characters before recognizing the
characters. In this paper, we describe a preprocessing method that extracts the character area and cuts off the unit of the character. Unlike existing research that presupposes a method of recognizing each word or character unit, or recognizing the remaining part after removing the stem of a continuous character, this method cuts the character into each recognizable unit and then combines the units. It can be applied to the method of recognizing letters. Through an experiment, the effectiveness of this method was verified.
